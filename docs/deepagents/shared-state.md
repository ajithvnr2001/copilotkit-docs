# Shared State

Create a two-way connection between your UI and agent state.

Open your coding agent in your project's folder, or in an empty folder for a new app.This runs in a coding agent on your computer.

## What is shared state?#

Agentic Copilots maintain a shared state that seamlessly connects your UI with the agent's execution. This shared state system allows you to:

  * Display the agent's current progress and intermediate results
  * Update the agent's state through UI interactions
  * React to state changes in real-time across your application

![Shared State Demo](https://cdn.copilotkit.ai/docs/copilotkit/images/coagents/SharedStateCoAgents.gif)

See this in Inspector

Open Inspector on localhost. Open a thread, then click **State**. Agent state updates here as the run proceeds.

More detail: [Inspector](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/deepagents/inspector).

## When should I use this?#

Use shared state when you want the agent and the user to collaborate through the same application state. The agent's outputs are reflected in the UI, and user updates in the UI are reflected in the agent's execution.

## Reading agent state#

Subscribe a component to the agent's state with `useAgent`. Any time the agent mutates its state, for example via a tool call, the hook fires and your UI re-renders with the new values.

Missing snippet

No demo found for `deepagents::shared-state-read-write`. Known demos are bundled from manifest `demos[i]`; check the cell id and framework slug.

The returned `agent.state` is just a plain object. Read it like any other piece of React state and render the parts you care about: agent-written notes, structured outputs, progress indicators, anything the agent has put there.

## Writing agent state#

The same `agent` object exposes a `setState` setter. Calling it from a UI event handler pushes the new value into shared state, and the agent reads it back on its next turn. The UI's writes visibly steer the model.

Missing snippet

No demo found for `deepagents::shared-state-read-write`. Known demos are bundled from manifest `demos[i]`; check the cell id and framework slug.

This is what makes the channel two-way: the UI doesn't just observe the agent, it can hand the agent fresh inputs (preferences, selections, partial work) without going through the chat thread.

## Rendering shared state in the UI#

Because `agent.state` is plain React data, the UI layer is whatever you'd normally build. The demo on this page wires the agent's outputs into a small card component and feeds user edits back through `setState`.

Missing snippet

No demo found for `deepagents::shared-state-read-write`. Known demos are bundled from manifest `demos[i]`; check the cell id and framework slug.

Nothing about this is chat-specific: `useAgent` works in any component under `<CopilotKit>`, so you can render `agent.state` in your main view or canvas, not just inside the chat panel. See **[Render agent state in your app](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/deepagents/shared-state/rendering-in-app)** for the full main-view pattern.

## Streaming partial state updates#

By default, agent state only updates _between_ backend checkpoints, so a long-running tool call appears as one big burst at the end. State streaming forwards a specific tool argument straight into a state key _as it's being generated_ , so the UI can watch the answer assemble token-by-token.

Missing snippet

No demo found for `deepagents::shared-state-streaming`. Known demos are bundled from manifest `demos[i]`; check the cell id and framework slug.

See **[State streaming](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/deepagents/shared-state/streaming)** for the full walkthrough, including the corresponding `useAgent` subscription on the frontend.

## Read-only context#

When the value is **UI-owned** and the agent should read it but never write it back, such as current user, selected record, or scroll position, reach for `useAgentContext` instead of full shared state. It publishes values as a one-way UI-to-agent channel that auto-unregisters on unmount.

See **[Agent read-only context](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/deepagents/shared-state/agent-readonly)** for the full pattern.
