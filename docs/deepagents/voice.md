# Voice

Real-time speech-to-text in the chat composer. The user speaks, the runtime transcribes, the agent runs the resulting prompt.

Not available for Deep Agents yet

This feature (`voice`) hasn't been tagged in any Deep Agents cell yet. Try [CopilotKit's Built-in Agent](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/built-in-agent/voice), [LangGraph (Python)](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/langgraph-python/voice), [LangGraph (TypeScript)](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/langgraph-typescript/voice).

You have a working chat surface and you want users to be able to speak instead of type. By the end of this guide, the chat composer will sprout a mic button, recorded audio will be transcribed by the runtime, and the transcript will auto-send to the agent like any other message.

## When to use this#

  * **Hands-free or accessibility flows** where typing isn't the right input modality.
  * **Mobile or kiosk surfaces** where a long voice query is faster than thumb-typing.
  * **Demo and test loops** where you want canned audio to drive the chat without a microphone.



If you only need file uploads (audio, images, video, documents), use [Multimodal Attachments](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/deepagents/multimodal-attachments) instead. Voice is specifically about live transcription of recorded speech into chat input.

## Frontend#

`<CopilotChat />` from `@copilotkit/react-core/v2` renders the mic button automatically when the runtime advertises `audioFileTranscriptionEnabled: true` on its `/info` endpoint. There's nothing to wire up on the chat surface itself:

Missing snippet

No demo found for `deepagents::voice`. Known demos are bundled from manifest `demos[i]`; check the cell id and framework slug.

The `runtimeUrl="/api/copilotkit-voice"` points the browser to your Next.js API route. When the user clicks the mic, the chat captures audio, POSTs it to that runtime route's `/transcribe` endpoint, drops the resulting transcript into the composer, and submits.

### Driving the demo without a mic#

For Playwright runs, screenshots, or any flow where prompting for mic permissions is awkward, ship a button that emits a canned sample phrase through an `onTranscribed` callback, bypassing the transcription endpoint entirely:

No demo found for `deepagents::voice`. Known demos are bundled from manifest `demos[i]`; check the cell id and framework slug.

The parent chat component can then drop that text into the composer's textarea (matched via `data-testid="copilot-chat-textarea"`) using the native value setter and a synthetic `input` event so React's managed state updates correctly.

## Backend#

### Next.js API route#

Create a dedicated API route at `app/api/copilotkit-voice/[[...slug]]/route.ts`. The `[[...slug]]` catch-all pattern lets the V2 runtime handle its internal URL routing (`/info`, `/agent/:id/run`, `/transcribe`, etc.) under the `/api/copilotkit-voice` base path.

Wire up the V2 runtime with a `TranscriptionService`. The V1 wrapper drops the `transcriptionService` option, so use `createCopilotRuntimeHandler` from `@copilotkit/runtime/v2` directly:

Missing snippet

No demo found for `deepagents::voice`. Known demos are bundled from manifest `demos[i]`; check the cell id and framework slug.

The `basePath: "/api/copilotkit-voice"` in `createCopilotRuntimeHandler` must match the API route's directory path. With `transcriptionService` set, the runtime advertises `audioFileTranscriptionEnabled: true` on `/info` (which is what tells the chat to render the mic button) and routes `POST /transcribe` to the service.

Without a service, `/transcribe` answers 503

A runtime with no `transcriptionService` still serves the route, and answers every request `503` with `{ "error": "service_not_configured" }`. The mic button never appears, so the symptom is a chat with no voice input rather than a visible server error — check `/info` for `audioFileTranscriptionEnabled` when voice silently doesn't show up.

Calling `/transcribe` yourself

The chat handles this for you; these are the rules if you post to the route directly. As multipart, the audio field must be named `audio` — any other name reads as absent and the route answers `invalid_request`. As JSON, `mimeType` is required alongside the base64 `audio`, and a payload without it is rejected the same way.

### Custom transcription backends#

`TranscriptionService` from `@copilotkit/runtime/v2` is an abstract class. Subclass it to plug in any transcription provider — Whisper, AssemblyAI, Deepgram, your own model. The library ships `TranscriptionServiceOpenAI` as the canonical reference implementation.

Return a string, and let provider errors through

`transcribe` returns the transcript as a string — the handler wraps it into `{ transcription }` itself, so returning a richer object is a type error.

Let the provider's own errors propagate unchanged. The runtime classifies failures by reading the error text for markers like `rate`, `429`, `auth` and `too long`, so a provider message such as `OpenAI returned 429 rate limited` maps to the right error code on its own. Replacing it with your own wording bypasses that and everything lands as a generic provider error.

A useful pattern is constructing the service only when its dedicated credential is configured. Without it, omit `transcriptionService`; the runtime reports the capability as disabled, hides the mic, and returns the documented 503 if `/transcribe` is called directly:
