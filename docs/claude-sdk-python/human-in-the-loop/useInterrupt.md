# Pausing the Agent for Input

Pause an agent run mid-tool, hand control to a custom React component, and resume with the user's answer.

Not supported on Claude Agent SDK (Python)

Claude Agent SDK (Python) doesn't support Human in the Loop: Interrupts. See [the framework grid](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/) for which integrations support this feature.

## What is this?#

`useInterrupt` lets your agent pause mid-run, hand control to the user through a custom React component, and resume with whatever the user returns. How that pause is implemented depends on the framework's runtime.

Some runtimes cannot pause a run mid-tool the way LangGraph's `interrupt()` does, so this demo uses `useFrontendTool` with a Promise-based handler instead. The agent calls `schedule_meeting` like any other tool; the client-side handler renders the picker, holds the request open, and only resolves the Promise once the user picks a slot or cancels. Same UX from the reader's perspective — agent pauses, user answers, agent resumes — different mechanism underneath.

## When should I use this?#

Reach for `useInterrupt` when the pause is a **graph-enforced checkpoint** where the code path _must_ stop and wait for a human, not an LLM-initiated tool call. Typical cases:

  * A sensitive action (payments, irreversible writes) must be approved
  * A required piece of state isn't known and can only be collected from the user
  * The agent explicitly reaches an approval node in a longer workflow
  * You want the server-side contract to be `interrupt(...)` and resume with a payload



For LLM-initiated pauses where the model decides on the fly to ask the user, prefer [`useHumanInTheLoop`](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/claude-sdk-python/human-in-the-loop/human-in-the-loop).

## The frontend: `useFrontendTool` with a Promise-resolving handler#

The handler stores its `resolve` callback in a ref, returns a Promise that the user's pick eventually resolves, and renders the picker inline in the chat. This is the frontend-tool equivalent of `useInterrupt`'s `event` / `resolve` pair:

## The backend: agent instructed to call the frontend tool#

The agent has no local `schedule_meeting` implementation — the tool is registered entirely on the frontend. The backend's only job is to instruct the model to call `schedule_meeting` whenever the user wants to book a meeting. AG-UI routes the tool call to the client, where the Promise-returning handler takes over:

## AG-UI standard interrupt flow vs. legacy#

`useInterrupt` supports two interrupt transports. Understanding which one your agent uses helps you write the right `render` code.

### Standard flow (`RUN_FINISHED` with `outcome.type === "interrupt"`)#

When the agent backend conforms to the AG-UI protocol, it signals an interrupt by emitting a `RUN_FINISHED` event whose outcome carries the interrupts array:
    
    
    outcome.type === "interrupt"
    outcome.interrupts  // Interrupt[]

The hook detects this on `onRunFinishedEvent` and exposes the interrupts on the render props **after** `onRunFinalized` fires. Your `render` function receives:

  * **`interrupt`** — the primary `Interrupt` (`interrupts[0]`), with shape `{ id, reason, message?, toolCallId?, responseSchema?, expiresAt?, metadata? }`.
  * **`interrupts`** — the full open set (usually one, but multi-interrupt is supported — see below).
  * **`resolve(payload?, interruptId?)`** — records `{ status: "resolved", payload }` for the targeted interrupt (defaults to the primary). The agent run resumes once every open interrupt has a response.
  * **`cancel(interruptId?)`** — records `{ status: "cancelled" }` for the targeted interrupt. Same accumulate-then-submit logic applies.



### Legacy flow (`on_interrupt` custom event)#

Older agents (or agents not yet migrated to the AG-UI interrupt spec) emit a custom `on_interrupt` event. The hook detects this on `onCustomEvent` and sets `interrupt` to `null` and `interrupts` to `[]`. The payload is in `event.value`. Calling `resolve(payload)` resumes via `forwardedProps.command` (the legacy resume mechanism). `cancel()` dismisses the interrupt without resuming — the agent never receives a response.

### Priority#

If both signals appear on the same run (unlikely but possible during migration), the standard flow wins.

### Approve / Cancel example#
    
    
    function ApprovalInterrupt() {
      useInterrupt({
        render: ({ interrupt, resolve, cancel }) => (
          <div className="p-3 border rounded">
            <p>{interrupt?.message ?? "Approve this action?"}</p>
            <div className="mt-2 flex gap-2">
              <button onClick={() => resolve({ approved: true })}>Approve</button>
              <button onClick={() => cancel()}>Cancel</button>
            </div>
          </div>
        ),
      });
      return null;
    }

`resolve({ approved: true })` records a resolved entry and submits the `resume` array to the agent. `cancel()` records a cancelled entry and does the same. Both return the `RunAgentResult` once the run restarts.

### Multi-interrupt behavior#

Some agents issue more than one interrupt in a single run (e.g. two independent approvals). Each interrupt has its own `id`. Address them individually:
    
    
    useInterrupt({
      render: ({ interrupts, resolve, cancel }) => (
        <ul>
          {interrupts.map((i) => (
            <li key={i.id}>
              {i.message}
              <button onClick={() => resolve({ ok: true }, i.id)}>Approve</button>
              <button onClick={() => cancel(i.id)}>Cancel</button>
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      ),
    });

The agent run only resumes once **every** open interrupt has been addressed. Calling `resolve` or `cancel` with a specific `interruptId` marks that interrupt done; the hook auto-submits the accumulated responses when the last one is addressed. If you omit `interruptId`, the primary interrupt (`interrupts[0]`) is targeted.

### `responseSchema` — surface only, no client-side validation#

The `Interrupt` type exposes a `responseSchema` field (a JSON Schema object) that the agent can use to describe the expected payload shape. `useInterrupt` surfaces this field on `interrupt.responseSchema` for your UI to read (e.g. to drive a form), but it does **not** validate `resolve` payloads against it. Validation is the agent's responsibility on resume.

## Going further#

  * [Tool-based HITL with `useHumanInTheLoop`](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/claude-sdk-python/human-in-the-loop/human-in-the-loop) — for LLM-initiated pauses.
  * [Headless interrupts](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/claude-sdk-python/human-in-the-loop/useInterrupt/headless) — compose the lower-level primitives (`useAgent`, `agent.subscribe`, `copilotkit.runAgent`) to resolve interrupts outside a chat surface.
