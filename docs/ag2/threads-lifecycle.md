# Thread & History Lifecycle

How a threadId is created, how conversation history is restored, how to switch or start threads, and how CopilotKit threads relate to your agent framework's own persistence.

## What is this?#

Every CopilotKit conversation is scoped to a **thread** , identified by a `threadId`. This page explains the full lifecycle of that thread on the client: how the id is created, how prior history is restored when a conversation loads, how to switch between threads or start a new one, and where CopilotKit's threads end and your agent framework's own persistence (e.g. a LangGraph checkpointer) begins.

This page describes the **v2** hooks and components imported from `@copilotkit/react-core/v2`. The v1 API (`useCopilotChat`, `initialMessages`, the v1 `useThreads`) behaves differently; see the v1 vs v2 notes at the end.

## The lifecycle at a glance#

  1. **Mint.** When a chat mounts without an explicit `threadId`, the client generates one (a UUID v4).
  2. **Run.** Messages and tool calls stream under that `threadId`. If a server-side store is configured (CopilotKit Intelligence, or a persisting `AgentRunner`), they are persisted as they happen so the thread can be replayed later. A runtime with no persistence layer keeps nothing server-side. See [AG-UI Streams & Framework Threads](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/ag2/intelligence/threads-explained) for the full server-side model.
  3. **Hydrate.** When a chat mounts _with_ a known `threadId`, the client connects and replays the persisted history into the UI.
  4. **Switch / start.** You change the active thread (restoring its history) or start a fresh one (clearing the view).



## How the threadId is created#

When you don't supply one, CopilotKit mints a `threadId` **on the client, at mount** , using a UUID v4. The value is resolved by this precedence (highest first):

  1. An explicit `threadId` prop on `<CopilotChat>` / `<CopilotChatConfigurationProvider>` (this is _authoritative_ : it also drives history replay and disables the welcome screen).
  2. An active-thread override set via `setActiveThreadId(...)` / a picked thread row / `startNewThread()`.
  3. A `threadId` inherited from a parent configuration provider.
  4. A non-authoritative `threadId` seed.
  5. Otherwise, a freshly minted `randomUUID()`.



Explicit threadId (recommended when you own persistence)
    
    
    import { CopilotChat } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
    
    // You control the id: history replays for it, and it's stable across remounts.
    <CopilotChat agentId="my-agent" threadId={myThreadId} />

**Auto-minted ids are stable across re-renders, but re-mint on remount.** The fallback id is computed with `useMemo`, so a component _remount_ (a changed React `key`, a parent unmount/remount, or React StrictMode's double-mount in dev) produces a **new** id and silently starts a new conversation. If you need an id that survives remounts, mint it yourself and pass it as the `threadId` prop (or persist it and restore it via `setActiveThreadId`). Don't rely on the auto-mint for continuity.

## How history is restored (hydration)#

CopilotKit v2 does **not** use an `initialMessages` prop to seed a conversation. History is restored one of two ways:

**1\. Server-side replay.** When a chat mounts with an _explicit_ `threadId`, the client sets `agent.threadId` and calls `connectAgent()`, which replays that thread's persisted event history back into the UI, with no manual message wiring:

History replays for a known threadId (given a server-side store)
    
    
    <CopilotChat agentId="my-agent" threadId={someExistingThreadId} />

Replay requires a **server-side store to replay from** : CopilotKit Intelligence, or a persisting `AgentRunner` (e.g. the SQLite runner). A self-hosted runtime with no persistence layer has nothing to replay, so `connectAgent()` returns an empty stream and the conversation starts blank. If history isn't restoring, check that a store is configured, not the client code. The [Persistence Architecture](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/ag2/intelligence/threads-explained) page covers how replay works server-side.

For a _fresh_ (non-explicit) thread, e.g. after `startNewThread()`, there's nothing to replay, so `connect` is skipped and the message view is cleared.

**2\. Manual hydration.** If you're managing messages yourself (for non-platform or custom cases), read them from the agent and set them directly:

Read and set messages via the agent
    
    
    import { useAgent } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
    
    function MyComponent() {
      const { agent } = useAgent({ agentId: "my-agent" });
    
      // Read the current conversation
      const messages = agent.messages;
    
      // Replace it (e.g. hydrate from your own store)
      // agent.setMessages(myPersistedMessages);
    
      return null;
    }

There is no v2 `useCopilotChat` hook and no v2 `initialMessages` prop. Read messages from `useAgent().agent.messages` and mutate with `agent.setMessages(...)` / `agent.addMessage(...)`. (`initialMessages` still exists on the **v1** `useCopilotChat` hook; see below.)

## Scope AG-UI Streams to the signed-in user#

Your application owns end-user authentication. For an Intelligence-enabled Runtime, implement `identifyUser(request)` with the server-verified session or token from your auth provider and return a stable user `id` and `name`:

app/api/copilotkit/[[...slug]]/route.ts
    
    
    import { CopilotKitIntelligence, CopilotRuntime } from "@copilotkit/runtime/v2";
    
    // `apiKey` is the only required field. The key scopes the project, so there is
    // no separate project or organization id to pass. See Connect your runtime.
    const intelligence = new CopilotKitIntelligence({
      apiKey: process.env.CPK_INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY!,
    });
    
    const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
      agents: { default: agent },
      intelligence,
      identifyUser: async (request) => {
        const session = await verifyAppSession(request); // Your server-side auth.
        if (!session?.user) throw new Error("Unauthorized");
    
        return {
          id: session.user.id,
          name: session.user.name,
        };
      },
    });

CopilotKit Intelligence combines that application user identity with the selected project when it scopes thread lists, subscriptions, history, rename, archive, unarchive, and delete operations. The project Runtime API key is a separate credential: keep it on the server and do not use the developer who created that key as the application user.

[Connect your runtime to Intelligence](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/ag2/intelligence/quickstart) covers the `CopilotKitIntelligence` constructor in full — where the project API key comes from, the self-hosted `apiUrl` / `wsUrl` override rule, and how to confirm the credential is actually being read rather than silently ignored.

A static `identifyUser` value is suitable only for a single-user demo. In a multi-user application, every request must resolve the authenticated application user or those users will share the same thread scope.

See [Authentication](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/ag2/auth) for forwarding and verifying your provider's auth context. `identifyUser` is the additional Runtime contract that assigns the verified application user to threads.

## Switching threads and starting new ones#

Set the active thread to restore its history, or start a fresh conversation:

Switch or start a thread
    
    
    import { useCopilotChatConfiguration } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
    
    function ThreadControls() {
      const config = useCopilotChatConfiguration();
    
      return (
        <>
          {/* Restore a known conversation (explicit → replays history) */}
          <button onClick={() => config?.setActiveThreadId(existingId, { explicit: true })}>
            Open conversation
          </button>
    
          {/* Start a fresh, empty conversation (mints a new non-explicit id) */}
          <button onClick={() => config?.startNewThread()}>New chat</button>
        </>
      );
    }

  * `setActiveThreadId(threadId, { explicit })`: `explicit: true` (the default) treats it as a known thread and replays its history, while `explicit: false` shows the welcome screen.
  * `startNewThread()`: resets to a freshly minted, non-explicit id. Also available from `useThreads()` for thread-sidebar UIs.



Both setters **no-op and log a warning when the`threadId` is prop-controlled** (i.e. you passed an authoritative `threadId` prop). If you drive threads imperatively with these setters, don't also pass a `threadId` prop. Pick one source of truth.

## Creating a thread with your own API on the first message#

A common ask: intercept the user's first message to mint a thread via your own backend (e.g. create a DB row and get its id) before the conversation starts.

**On the built-in`<CopilotChat>` this cannot be done through `onSubmitMessage`**: the component sets its own submit handler internally and discards any you pass. Instead, use one of these approaches.

**Recommended: mint up front and drive the id.** Create your thread when the user starts a new conversation (e.g. on a "New chat" action, or lazily just before you render the chat), then hand the id to CopilotKit:

Mint your thread, then drive it
    
    
    async function startConversation() {
      const { id } = await myApi.createThread(); // your backend
      config?.setActiveThreadId(id, { explicit: true });
      // or render <CopilotChat threadId={id} />
    }

**At submit-time (headless only).** If you must intercept exactly when the user hits send, compose the UI yourself with `CopilotChatInput` / `CopilotChatView` and pass your own `onSubmitMessage` (the built-in `<CopilotChat>` ignores it). Because the handler is yours, you set the thread on the agent and drive the send:

Headless: set the thread on the agent before sending
    
    
    import { CopilotChatInput, useAgent } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
    
    function MyInput() {
      const { agent } = useAgent({ agentId: "my-agent" });
    
      return (
        <CopilotChatInput
          onSubmitMessage={async (text) => {
            const { id } = await myApi.createThread(); // your backend
            agent.threadId = id;                       // set it on the agent directly
            agent.addMessage({ role: "user", content: text });
            // ...then trigger the run with your send logic
          }}
        />
      );
    }

For a send you fire in the same handler, set the id on the **agent** (`agent.threadId = id`); don't rely on `setActiveThreadId(id)`. `setActiveThreadId` updates React state and only reaches the agent on the next render (and only when a `<CopilotChat>` is mounted to sync it), so a run kicked off immediately would still use the previous thread. Use `setActiveThreadId` / `startNewThread` for switching threads in the UI, and set `agent.threadId` directly when it must take effect before an imperative send.

`onSubmitMessage` is only a real interception seam in the **headless** path. On the built-in `<CopilotChat>` it's overridden, so reach for the "mint up front" approach there.

## CopilotKit threads vs. your framework's checkpointer#

These are **two different layers** , correlated only by the shared `threadId`:

Layer| What it stores| Managed by  
---|---|---  
**CopilotKit threads**|  Conversation list + full AG-UI event history (messages, tool calls, state), with realtime sync| CopilotKit Intelligence, via `useThreads`  
**Framework-native persistence**|  Framework-internal state/checkpoints| Your agent, e.g. a LangGraph `AsyncPostgresSaver`  
  
A LangGraph checkpointer (an `AsyncPostgresSaver` \+ `compile(checkpointer=...)`) creates LangGraph's own **checkpoint tables**. It does _not_ create a CopilotKit "threads" table, and you won't see a threads table appear just from configuring a checkpointer. Conversely, `useThreads` rename/archive/delete operate on platform threads and do **not** reach into LangGraph (or ADK, etc.) stores unless your backend explicitly bridges them.

The bridge between the two is the `threadId`: when you pass an explicit CopilotKit `threadId`, it's forwarded to the backend as the AG-UI `threadId`, which your framework can use directly as (or map to) its own checkpoint/thread id.

### Future runs can remain durable in both places#

Once Intelligence is connected, conversations that run through that runtime are recorded automatically in Intelligence. Historical import is optional. If your LangGraph agent continues using a durable checkpointer or LangGraph Platform, those same runs also continue through LangGraph's native persistence. The same applies to an ADK agent that remains connected to a durable session service with retained sessions. This lets you keep native framework storage and analytics while users get replay, generative UI, multimodal history, and realtime continuity through CopilotKit.

This is coordinated persistence during future CopilotKit-mediated runs, not general database replication. CopilotKit lifecycle actions such as rename, archive, and delete apply to the CopilotKit Intelligence thread; they do not rename, archive, or delete records in the native framework store.

See [LangGraph persistence](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/integrations/langgraph/advanced/persistence/message-persistence) for the framework-native (checkpointer) side, and [Importing and synchronizing thread history](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/ag2/threads-import) for bringing existing framework conversations into the platform store. (LangGraph _Platform_ requires thread ids to be UUIDs, which CopilotKit's auto-minted ids already are.)

## Example: keep an existing LangGraph conversation#

Follow [Bring your own thread system](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/ag2/intelligence/bring-your-own-thread-system#example-keep-an-existing-langgraph-conversation) for an example that keeps native persistence and continues the same conversation.

## MCP Apps activity and history#

MCP Apps render through **activity messages** (`activityType: "mcp-apps"`), and that rendering is a **client-side** concern: the registered renderer resolves the referenced UI resource and runs any follow-up in the browser. So the visible MCP App UI is _re-derived on the client from the conversation_ when it loads. It isn't a separately-stored artifact you persist on its own.

Practically, MCP App UI restores the same way the rest of the conversation does: if your server-side store replays the thread's history (see server-side replay above), the tool-call/activity messages come back and the renderers run again on hydration. There's no separate MCP-Apps store to configure.

## v1 vs v2#

  * **v2** (`@copilotkit/react-core/v2`): `useThreads` returns the platform thread list; `threadId` lives per-chat (on `<CopilotChat>` / `<CopilotChatConfigurationProvider>`), not on the provider; read messages via `useAgent().agent.messages` and mutate via `agent.setMessages(...)`. No `initialMessages`.
  * **v1** (`@copilotkit/react-core`): `useThreads` returns `{ threadId, setThreadId, isThreadIdExplicit }` (a single-conversation id manager, not the platform list). Its `setThreadId` silently no-ops when a `threadId` prop is present, because the prop shadows internal state. `<CopilotKit threadId>` sets the id at the provider, and `useCopilotChat()` exposes `setMessages(...)` and an `initialMessages` option. (Separately, the `setThreadId` on the main `<CopilotKit>` hooks _throws_ if you call it while `threadId` is prop-supplied.)
