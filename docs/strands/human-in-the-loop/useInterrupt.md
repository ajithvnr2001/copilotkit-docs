## What is this?#

`useInterrupt` lets your agent pause mid-run, hand control to the user through a custom React component, and resume with whatever the user returns. How that pause is implemented depends on the framework's runtime.

This framework ships a first-class interrupt primitive that lets running work suspend itself and hand control to the client ([LangGraph](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/interrupts), [AWS Strands](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/concepts/interrupts/)). The run is frozen server-side until the client resolves the interrupt with a payload, at which point execution resumes as if the interrupt call had simply returned that payload.

CopilotKit's `useInterrupt` is the frontend half of that contract: it subscribes to the paused run, renders whatever component you give it, and calls the agent back with the user's answer.

## When should I use this?#

Reach for `useInterrupt` when the pause is a **graph-enforced checkpoint** where the code path _must_ stop and wait for a human, not an LLM-initiated tool call. Typical cases:

  * A sensitive action (payments, irreversible writes) must be approved
  * A required piece of state isn't known and can only be collected from the user
  * The agent explicitly reaches an approval node in a longer workflow
  * You want the server-side contract to be `interrupt(...)` and resume with a payload



For LLM-initiated pauses where the model decides on the fly to ask the user, prefer [`useHumanInTheLoop`](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/strands/human-in-the-loop/human-in-the-loop).

## The backend: `interrupt()` inside a tool#

### Pause a tool with Strands' native interrupt

AWS Strands ships a first-class [interrupt primitive](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/concepts/interrupts/). A tool declared with `@tool(context=True)` calls `tool_context.interrupt(name, reason=...)`, which halts the agent loop and hands `reason` to the client as the interrupt payload. The AG-UI adapter finishes the run with `RUN_FINISHED` carrying `outcome.type == "interrupt"`.

src/agents/interrupt_agent.py
    
    
    @tool(context=True)
    def schedule_meeting(topic: str, tool_context: ToolContext, attendee: str = "") -> str:
        """Ask the user to pick a meeting time, then confirm what was scheduled.
    
        Args:
            topic: Short description of the meeting purpose.
            attendee: Who the meeting is with, if known.
        """
        answer = tool_context.interrupt(
            "schedule_meeting",
            reason={"topic": topic, "attendee": attendee},
        )
    
        # Neither the envelope nor the value inside it is guaranteed to be a
        # mapping: `ag_ui_strands` wraps a resolved answer as `{"response": ...}`
        # and a cancel as `{"cancelled": True}`, but the payload itself is whatever
        # the client sent, and a client that answers with a bare value would make
        # `answer.get` raise inside the tool. Both levels are checked.
        envelope: Mapping = answer if isinstance(answer, Mapping) else {}
        # `ag_ui_strands` wraps the answer under "response"; a bridge that passes
        # the client payload through (the published TypeScript one does) hands the
        # payload itself, so a mapping without that key IS the payload.
        inner = envelope["response"] if "response" in envelope else envelope
        payload = inner if isinstance(inner, Mapping) else {}
        cancelled = (
            envelope.get("cancelled")
            or envelope.get("status") == "cancelled"
            or payload.get("cancelled")
            or payload.get("status") == "cancelled"
        )
        if cancelled:
            return f"User cancelled. Meeting NOT scheduled: {topic}"
    
        label = payload.get("chosen_label") or payload.get("chosen_time")
        if not label:
            return f"User did not pick a time. Meeting NOT scheduled: {topic}"
        return f"Meeting scheduled for {label}: {topic}"
    
    

The resume payload arrives wrapped: an answer as `{"response": ...}`, a client-side cancel as `{"cancelled": True}`. The adapter wraps it because Strands' resume gate is truthiness-based, so a bare falsy answer would re-raise the same interrupt forever.

### Keep the pausing tool off a client-executed name

`useHumanInTheLoop` registers its tool on the FRONTEND, so a name used there cannot also be a pausing backend tool. This showcase mounts a dedicated interrupt agent and points the interrupt demos' agent names at it, leaving `schedule_meeting` on the shared agent free for the frontend-tool flow.

### Resume in the same process, or across a restart

Pause and resume on the same running process need no extra wiring. For a resume that survives a restart, give the agent a Strands `SessionManager` through `StrandsAgentConfig.session_manager_provider`; the adapter persists its interrupt checkpoint into that session.

The example agent exposes a `schedule_meeting` tool. When the model calls it, the tool interrupts itself with the meeting context. The run freezes here until the client resolves; the resolution becomes the return value of the interrupt call, which the tool then turns into a final string for the model:

interrupt_agent.py
    
    
    @tool(context=True)def schedule_meeting(topic: str, tool_context: ToolContext, attendee: str = "") -> str:    """Ask the user to pick a meeting time, then confirm what was scheduled.    Args:        topic: Short description of the meeting purpose.        attendee: Who the meeting is with, if known.    """    answer = tool_context.interrupt(        "schedule_meeting",        reason={"topic": topic, "attendee": attendee},    )    # Neither the envelope nor the value inside it is guaranteed to be a    # mapping: `ag_ui_strands` wraps a resolved answer as `{"response": ...}`    # and a cancel as `{"cancelled": True}`, but the payload itself is whatever    # the client sent, and a client that answers with a bare value would make    # `answer.get` raise inside the tool. Both levels are checked.    envelope: Mapping = answer if isinstance(answer, Mapping) else {}    # `ag_ui_strands` wraps the answer under "response"; a bridge that passes    # the client payload through (the published TypeScript one does) hands the    # payload itself, so a mapping without that key IS the payload.    inner = envelope["response"] if "response" in envelope else envelope    payload = inner if isinstance(inner, Mapping) else {}    cancelled = (        envelope.get("cancelled")        or envelope.get("status") == "cancelled"        or payload.get("cancelled")        or payload.get("status") == "cancelled"    )    if cancelled:        return f"User cancelled. Meeting NOT scheduled: {topic}"    label = payload.get("chosen_label") or payload.get("chosen_time")    if not label:        return f"User did not pick a time. Meeting NOT scheduled: {topic}"    return f"Meeting scheduled for {label}: {topic}"

Two things to note:

  * The payload (`{"topic": topic, "attendee": attendee}`) is what the frontend reads off the interrupt. Keep it a plain, serializable object. It's the "pause-time context" the UI needs to render. Where it lands depends on the bridge: LangGraph hands it to `render` as `event.value`, while a standard AG-UI interrupt carries it on the interrupt itself, either under `metadata` or JSON-encoded into `message`. Read the channels your bridge uses rather than assuming one.
  * The return-side contract (`{chosen_label, chosen_time}` or `{cancelled: true}`) is entirely yours. The client can send anything as the resolve payload; the tool is the one that gives it meaning.



## The frontend: `useInterrupt` render prop#

On the client you register a `useInterrupt` hook per agent. When the paused run arrives, `render` receives both the raw `event` and the `interrupt` itself, and `resolve(...)` is how you resume the run. Where the payload sits depends on how the framework pauses: a legacy custom-event interrupt carries it on `event.value`, while a standard AG-UI interrupt carries it on the `interrupt` (its `metadata`, or a JSON-encoded `message`, depending on the bridge). Read the channel your framework uses:

The rejection is            // re-surfaced rather than dropped, because the card has already            // shown a green "Booked" badge by then and a silently failed            // resume would leave the user reading a success that never            // happened.            window.setTimeout(() => {              void resolve(result).catch((error: unknown) => {                setResumeFailed(true);                queueMicrotask(() => {                  throw error;                });              });            }, 500);          }}        />      );    },  });

Whatever you pass to `resolve` is round-tripped back to the agent as the return value of the matching `interrupt(...)` call.

### Key props#

  * **`agentId`** — must match a runtime-registered agent. If omitted, the hook assumes `"default"`. A mismatch means the interrupt never fires.
  * **`render`** — receives `{ event, interrupt, resolve }`. The payload you passed to `interrupt(...)` on the server arrives on `event.value` for a legacy custom-event interrupt and on the `interrupt` for a standard one.
  * **`renderInChat`** — when `true` (as above), the picker appears inline in the chat transcript, between the paused assistant turn and the still-pending continuation.



## Multiple interrupts? Add a type and gate with `enabled`#

If your graph issues more than one kind of interrupt (e.g. `"ask"` vs `"approval"`), tag each with a `type` field on the payload and install one `useInterrupt` per shape, each gated by an `enabled` predicate:
    
    
    useInterrupt({
      agentId: "gen-ui-interrupt",
      enabled: (event) => event.value.type === "ask",
      render: ({ event, resolve }) => (
        <AskCard question={event.value.content} onAnswer={resolve} />
      ),
    });
    
    useInterrupt({
      agentId: "gen-ui-interrupt",
      enabled: (event) => event.value.type === "approval",
      render: ({ event, resolve }) => (
        <ApproveCard content={event.value.content} onAnswer={resolve} />
      ),
    });

## Preprocess with `handler`#

For cases where the interrupt can sometimes be resolved _without_ user input (e.g. the current user already has permission), pass a `handler` that runs before `render`. The handler can call `resolve(...)` itself to resume the agent early — the interrupt card unmounts when the resume run starts. Or return a value that `render` receives as `result`:
    
    
    useInterrupt({
      agentId: "gen-ui-interrupt",
      handler: async ({ event, resolve }) => {
        const dept = await lookupUserDepartment();
        if (event.value.accessDepartment === dept || dept === "admin") {
          resolve({ code: "AUTH_BY_DEPARTMENT" });
          return; // agent will resume; card unmounts when the run starts
        }
        return { dept };
      },
      render: ({ result, event, resolve }) => (
        <RequestAccessCard
          dept={result?.dept}
          onRequest={() => resolve({ code: "REQUEST_AUTH" })}
          onCancel={() => resolve({ code: "CANCEL" })}
        />
      ),
    });

## AG-UI standard interrupt flow vs. legacy#

`useInterrupt` supports two interrupt transports. Understanding which one your agent uses helps you write the right `render` code.

### Standard flow (`RUN_FINISHED` with `outcome.type === "interrupt"`)#

When the agent backend conforms to the AG-UI protocol, it signals an interrupt by emitting a `RUN_FINISHED` event whose outcome carries the interrupts array:
    
    
    outcome.type === "interrupt"
    outcome.interrupts  // Interrupt[]

The hook detects this on `onRunFinishedEvent` and exposes the interrupts on the render props **after** `onRunFinalized` fires. Your `render` function receives:

  * **`interrupt`** — the primary `Interrupt` (`interrupts[0]`), with shape `{ id, reason, message?, toolCallId?, responseSchema?, expiresAt?, metadata? }`.
  * **`interrupts`** — the full open set (usually one, but multi-interrupt is supported — see below).
  * **`resolve(payload?, interruptId?)`** — records `{ status: "resolved", payload }` for the targeted interrupt (defaults to the primary). The agent run resumes once every open interrupt has a response.
  * **`cancel(interruptId?)`** — records `{ status: "cancelled" }` for the targeted interrupt. Same accumulate-then-submit logic applies.



### Legacy flow (`on_interrupt` custom event)#

Older agents (or agents not yet migrated to the AG-UI interrupt spec) emit a custom `on_interrupt` event. The hook detects this on `onCustomEvent` and sets `interrupt` to `null` and `interrupts` to `[]`. The payload is in `event.value`. Calling `resolve(payload)` resumes via `forwardedProps.command` (the legacy resume mechanism). `cancel()` dismisses the interrupt without resuming — the agent never receives a response.

### Priority#

If both signals appear on the same run (unlikely but possible during migration), the standard flow wins.

### Approve / Cancel example#
    
    
    function ApprovalInterrupt() {
      useInterrupt({
        render: ({ interrupt, resolve, cancel }) => (
          <div className="p-3 border rounded">
            <p>{interrupt?.message ?? "Approve this action?"}</p>
            <div className="mt-2 flex gap-2">
              <button onClick={() => resolve({ approved: true })}>Approve</button>
              <button onClick={() => cancel()}>Cancel</button>
            </div>
          </div>
        ),
      });
      return null;
    }

`resolve({ approved: true })` records a resolved entry and submits the `resume` array to the agent. `cancel()` records a cancelled entry and does the same. Both return the `RunAgentResult` once the run restarts.

### Multi-interrupt behavior#

Some agents issue more than one interrupt in a single run (e.g. two independent approvals). Each interrupt has its own `id`. Address them individually:
    
    
    useInterrupt({
      render: ({ interrupts, resolve, cancel }) => (
        <ul>
          {interrupts.map((i) => (
            <li key={i.id}>
              {i.message}
              <button onClick={() => resolve({ ok: true }, i.id)}>Approve</button>
              <button onClick={() => cancel(i.id)}>Cancel</button>
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      ),
    });

The agent run only resumes once **every** open interrupt has been addressed. Calling `resolve` or `cancel` with a specific `interruptId` marks that interrupt done; the hook auto-submits the accumulated responses when the last one is addressed. If you omit `interruptId`, the primary interrupt (`interrupts[0]`) is targeted.

### `responseSchema` — surface only, no client-side validation#

The `Interrupt` type exposes a `responseSchema` field (a JSON Schema object) that the agent can use to describe the expected payload shape. `useInterrupt` surfaces this field on `interrupt.responseSchema` for your UI to read (e.g. to drive a form), but it does **not** validate `resolve` payloads against it. Validation is the agent's responsibility on resume.
