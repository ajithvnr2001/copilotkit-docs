# Message history

Trim the conversation history CopilotKit forwards to an agent that already stores its own.

Open your coding agent in your project's folder, or in an empty folder for a new app.This runs in a coding agent on your computer.

CopilotKit forwards the whole conversation on every run. The frontend holds the transcript, and each run carries it to your agent as `input.messages`. A stateless agent needs that, because the transcript is the only record of the conversation.

An agent that stores its own history does not need it. If your backend keeps a LangGraph checkpointer, Mastra memory, an AWS Strands `SessionManager`, or a Microsoft Agent Framework chat-history provider, then two copies of the conversation exist. This page shows how to forward less.

Most applications need one prop: `messageFilter` on the provider. The rest of this page covers the cases it does not reach, which are trimming inside the runtime and trimming an agent you construct yourself.

## When to trim#

Trim the forwarded history if your agent stores the conversation itself. Two symptoms point here:

  * **Duplicated history.** Your agent merges the messages CopilotKit sends with the messages it already stored, so the model receives every turn twice. Token cost doubles. The merge can also separate a tool call from its result. A backend whose stored history ends with a pending tool call appends the forwarded copy after that call. The call is then no longer followed by its result, and Anthropic rejects the run. This is the human-in-the-loop failure reported on [#1482](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/issues/1482#issuecomment-4555989351).
  * **Large requests.** The request body grows with the conversation. Long threads raise latency on every turn, and a proxy can reject the request with HTTP 413.



Do not trim if your agent is stateless. A stateless agent reads the conversation only from `input.messages`, so a trimmed payload erases its memory of the thread.

Keep tool calls and tool results together

Every tool result you forward must reach the model with its tool call, and the call must be answered by the message right after it. A filter that keeps "the last message only" splits that pair and breaks human-in-the-loop runs.

`messageFilter` repairs the pair for you, so the browser recipe below is safe however blunt your rule is. A middleware filter has to do it itself, which is what `lastTurnOnly` is for.

## Trim from the browser#

`messageFilter` on the provider decides what each run puts on the wire. Return the messages to send:

app/page.tsx
    
    
    import { CopilotKit } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
    
    <CopilotKit
      runtimeUrl="/api/copilotkit"
      messageFilter={(messages) => messages.slice(-1)}
    >
      <YourApp />
    </CopilotKit>;

This is the shortest fix for both symptoms at once. The request body shrinks, and your agent stops merging a second copy of the conversation into its own store. It reaches the agents CopilotKit discovers from `runtimeUrl`, which is the case most applications have.

A rule this blunt is safe here. CopilotKit repairs broken tool-call pairs before the request goes out, and the repair restores rather than discards: a forwarded tool result gets its call put back directly in front of it, and a forwarded call gets its result back. `slice(-1)` therefore cannot strand a human-in-the-loop approval.

Four things the filter does not touch:

  * **The chat UI.** It rewrites the request body only. The transcript renders in full.
  * **Agents you pass in yourself** through `selfManagedAgents`. Those instances are yours, so use a middleware on them — see below.
  * **CopilotKit Intelligence runs.** That runtime is the store of record for the thread, so the client does not get to truncate what reaches it.
  * **Suggestion runs.** A suggestion runs on a fresh thread, so the messages sent with it are the only context the provider has.



If the filter throws or returns something that is not an array, CopilotKit warns and sends the full thread. Trimming is an optimization, so a bug in it does not fail the run.

Prefer a stable reference, such as `useCallback` in React. An inline arrow re-registers the filter on every render, which is harmless but needless.

## Write a filter for middleware#

Use this instead when you trim inside the runtime, or on an agent you construct yourself. There is no repair pass on those paths, so the filter has to keep the pairs valid on its own. It needs two pieces: a filter that chooses the messages, and an [AG-UI middleware](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/ms-agent-python/agentic-protocols/ag-ui-middleware) that applies it. Put both in one module.

The filter below keeps the final turn, which is the last user message and everything after it. A tool call and its result normally sit inside one turn, so the pair survives. The rest covers the exception. A human-in-the-loop run can leave a tool call in an earlier turn, so the filter pulls that call back in. It pulls back only the calls that a forwarded result answers, because an assistant message can hold several tool calls and forwarding a call whose result you dropped recreates the error you are trying to avoid. It also puts each rescued call directly in front of the result that answers it, because a provider expects a tool call to be answered by the message right after it.

trim-history.ts
    
    
    import {
      Middleware,
      type AbstractAgent,
      type Message,
      type RunAgentInput,
    } from "@ag-ui/client";
    
    /** Keeps the final turn, plus any tool call a forwarded tool result needs. */
    export function lastTurnOnly(messages: Message[]): Message[] {
      let start = -1;
      for (let i = messages.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (messages[i].role === "user") {
          start = i;
          break;
        }
      }
      if (start === -1) return messages;
    
      const kept = messages.slice(start);
      const keptIds = new Set(kept.map((message) => message.id));
      const answeredIds = new Set(
        kept.flatMap((message) => (message.role === "tool" ? [message.toolCallId] : [])),
      );
    
      // Index the earlier assistant messages by the calls a kept result answers.
      // `Message` is a union, so the map holds the assistant member: only that one
      // carries `toolCalls`.
      const issuerOf = new Map<string, Extract<Message, { role: "assistant" }>>();
      for (const message of messages.slice(0, start)) {
        if (message.role !== "assistant" || keptIds.has(message.id)) continue;
        // Keep only the calls a forwarded result answers. An assistant message can
        // hold several calls, and a call whose result you drop must go too.
        const toolCalls = (message.toolCalls ?? []).filter((call) =>
          answeredIds.has(call.id),
        );
        if (toolCalls.length === 0) continue;
        const narrowed = { ...message, toolCalls };
        for (const call of toolCalls) issuerOf.set(call.id, narrowed);
      }
    
      // Put each rescued call directly in front of the result that answers it, and
      // keep that message's other results with it. A provider expects a tool call
      // to be answered by the messages right after it, so collecting the rescued
      // calls at the front, or letting anything separate a parallel call from one
      // of its results, recreates the error.
      const emittedIssuers = new Set<Extract<Message, { role: "assistant" }>>();
      const placedResults = new Set<string>();
      const forwarded: Message[] = [];
      for (const message of kept) {
        if (message.role === "tool") {
          if (placedResults.has(message.id)) continue;
          const issuer = issuerOf.get(message.toolCallId);
          if (issuer && !emittedIssuers.has(issuer)) {
            emittedIssuers.add(issuer);
            forwarded.push(issuer);
            for (const sibling of kept) {
              if (sibling.role !== "tool") continue;
              if (!issuer.toolCalls?.some((call) => call.id === sibling.toolCallId)) continue;
              placedResults.add(sibling.id);
              forwarded.push(sibling);
            }
            continue;
          }
        }
        forwarded.push(message);
      }
      return forwarded;
    }
    
    /** Rewrites the messages of one run, leaving the stored transcript alone. */
    export class TrimHistoryMiddleware extends Middleware {
      constructor(private readonly trim: (messages: Message[]) => Message[]) {
        super();
      }
    
      run(input: RunAgentInput, next: AbstractAgent) {
        return this.runNext({ ...input, messages: this.trim(input.messages) }, next);
      }
    }

Adapt the rule to what your backend stores. If your agent keeps the last ten turns, forward the same window.

### Check it on a turn with two tool calls#

One assistant message can hold several tool calls, and the kept turn can carry the result for only one of them. The rescue pass must forward that one call and drop the other, because a forwarded call whose result you dropped is the broken pair this page is about. Run this against your own filter:

check-trim-history.ts
    
    
    import { strict as assert } from "node:assert";
    import type { Message } from "@ag-ui/client";
    import { lastTurnOnly } from "./trim-history";
    
    const call = (id: string, name: string) => ({
      id,
      type: "function" as const,
      function: { name, arguments: "{}" },
    });
    
    // One earlier assistant message opens two calls. The kept turn answers only
    // the second one, because the first was resolved before the last user message.
    const messages: Message[] = [
      { id: "u1", role: "user", content: "book me a flight and a hotel" },
      { id: "a1", role: "assistant", toolCalls: [call("cA", "bookFlight"), call("cB", "bookHotel")] },
      { id: "t-a", role: "tool", toolCallId: "cA", content: "flight booked" },
      { id: "u2", role: "user", content: "yes, that hotel" },
      { id: "t-b", role: "tool", toolCallId: "cB", content: "hotel booked" },
    ];
    
    const trimmed = lastTurnOnly(messages);
    
    // Only the answered call is forwarded; `cA` was resolved before the kept turn.
    const forwardedCallIds = trimmed.flatMap((message) =>
      message.role === "assistant" ? (message.toolCalls ?? []).map((c) => c.id) : [],
    );
    assert.deepEqual(forwardedCallIds, ["cB"]);
    
    // And every forwarded call is answered by the message right after it, which is
    // what the provider requires. Presence somewhere in the list is not enough.
    trimmed.forEach((message, index) => {
      for (const toolCall of message.role === "assistant" ? (message.toolCalls ?? []) : []) {
        const next = trimmed[index + 1];
        assert.ok(
          next && next.role === "tool" && next.toolCallId === toolCall.id,
          `tool call ${toolCall.id} is not answered by the next message`,
        );
      }
    });
    
    // The stored transcript is untouched: `a1` still holds both calls.
    assert.equal(messages[1].role === "assistant" && messages[1].toolCalls?.length, 2);
    
    // A second run: both results of one parallel call are retained, and an
    // assistant message sits between them. The rescued call must stay with BOTH
    // results, so nothing separates it from either one.
    const parallel: Message[] = [
      { id: "u1", role: "user", content: "book both" },
      { id: "a1", role: "assistant", toolCalls: [call("cA", "bookFlight"), call("cB", "bookHotel")] },
      { id: "u2", role: "user", content: "go ahead" },
      { id: "t-a", role: "tool", toolCallId: "cA", content: "flight booked" },
      { id: "a3", role: "assistant", content: "one moment" },
      { id: "t-b", role: "tool", toolCallId: "cB", content: "hotel booked" },
    ];
    
    const trimmedParallel = lastTurnOnly(parallel);
    trimmedParallel.forEach((message, index) => {
      for (const toolCall of message.role === "assistant" ? (message.toolCalls ?? []) : []) {
        const answers = new Set<string>();
        for (let i = index + 1; trimmedParallel[i]?.role === "tool"; i++) {
          answers.add(trimmedParallel[i].toolCallId);
        }
        assert.ok(
          answers.has(toolCall.id),
          `tool call ${toolCall.id} is separated from its result`,
        );
      }
    });
    
    console.log("trim-history: forwarded only the answered call, next to its result");

## Trim inside the runtime#

The middleware rewrites `input.messages` before the run reaches your agent. It runs server-side, inside the runtime, so the browser cannot change it. Attach it to the agent before you register the agent with the runtime:

app/api/copilotkit/[[...slug]]/route.ts
    
    
    import { HttpAgent } from "@ag-ui/client";
    import { CopilotRuntime } from "@copilotkit/runtime/v2";
    import { lastTurnOnly, TrimHistoryMiddleware } from "./trim-history";
    
    const agent = new HttpAgent({ url: process.env.AGENT_URL! });
    agent.use(new TrimHistoryMiddleware(lastTurnOnly));
    
    const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
      agents: { default: agent },
    });

`.use()` is on `AbstractAgent`, so this works for any agent the runtime registers, whatever framework it wraps.

The runtime clones a registered agent for every run, and a clone keeps its middleware. One `.use()` call at startup therefore covers every run.

This placement fixes duplicated history. It does not shrink the request the browser sends, because the browser still posts the full transcript to your runtime. Use `messageFilter` for that, and note that it makes this placement redundant for most applications: reach for the runtime when the trimming rule has to be server-side, for example when it must hold whatever the frontend sends.

## Trim an agent you construct yourself#

The same middleware shrinks the request body when you attach it to an agent instance you construct yourself, through [`selfManagedAgents` or the local development option](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/ms-agent-python/backend/self-managed-agents). The filtered messages become the HTTP body, and the transcript in the UI stays whole. `selfManagedAgents` belongs to the Enterprise plan, so production use needs a `publicLicenseKey`.

app/page.tsx
    
    
    import { HttpAgent } from "@ag-ui/client";
    import { CopilotKit } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
    import { lastTurnOnly, TrimHistoryMiddleware } from "./trim-history";
    
    const supportAgent = new HttpAgent({ url: "https://agents.example.com/support" });
    supportAgent.use(new TrimHistoryMiddleware(lastTurnOnly));
    
    <CopilotKit selfManagedAgents={{ "support-agent": supportAgent }}>
      <YourApp />
    </CopilotKit>;

Use this only for agents you construct. CopilotKit owns the agents it discovers from `runtimeUrl`: a change to the runtime URL or the transport replaces one, and the replacement carries over the thread, the state and the messages, but not anything you attached yourself. `messageFilter` is the supported option for those, and it survives the replacement because CopilotKit re-applies it.

## What trimming does not change#

  * **The chat UI.** Trimming rewrites the payload of one run. The agent keeps its own message list, and the transcript renders in full.
  * **Runtime persistence.** A runtime that stores threads records the events of each run, so earlier turns stay in the thread.
  * **Agent state.** Neither mechanism touches `input.state`, `input.tools`, or `input.context`. Only the message list changes.
