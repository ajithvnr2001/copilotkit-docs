Headless Threads

BasicsThreads

# Headless Threads

Build a custom thread UI with useThreads while CopilotKit handles persistence, replay, synchronization, and lifecycle infrastructure.

Intelligence’s AG-UI streams power the history and delivery behind this custom UI. Use `useThreads` to list and manage conversations, and pass their `threadId` to your chat.

## What is this?#

The `useThreads` hook lists, creates, renames, archives, and deletes CopilotKit Intelligence threads with realtime synchronization via WebSocket. Threads work with any agent framework — CopilotKit Intelligence stores conversation history server-side, so users can close their browser and pick up where they left off. It does not list or mutate native LangGraph, ADK, or other framework stores unless your backend explicitly bridges those systems. Thread metadata updates (renames, archives, new threads) appear on connected clients without polling.

## Conversations that never lose context.

Open your coding agent in your project's folder, or in an empty folder for a new app.This runs in a coding agent on your computer.

CopilotKit Intelligence AG-UI Streams keep messages, generative UI, and tool activity available across sessions and devices. Build a new agent or bring one you already have. Any frontend, any backend. 

Prebuilt thread UI: Threads Drawer

If your app came from a CopilotKit CLI starter, it already includes the prebuilt **[Threads Drawer](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/ms-agent-python/prebuilt-components/copilot-threads-drawer)**. Keep it for the shortest path to a production thread switcher. Use the `useThreads` steps below when adding a custom thread UI to an existing app or replacing the Drawer with your own layout and interactions (including thread **rename** , which the prebuilt Drawer doesn't surface).

## When should I use this?#

  * Your app needs multiple saved conversations per user (like a chat history sidebar)
  * Users should be able to resume a prior conversation across sessions or devices
  * You want realtime sync so threads created on one tab appear on another
  * You need to let users organize conversations by renaming or archiving them



## Prerequisites#

  * A CopilotKit application connected to CopilotKit Intelligence
  * `@copilotkit/react-core` v1.56 or later
  * A model provider key supported by your runtime



For multi-user applications, configure the Runtime to [scope AG-UI Streams to the signed-in user](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/ms-agent-python/threads-lifecycle#scope-rich-threads-to-the-signed-in-user) before exposing thread lists or lifecycle actions.

## Implementation#

Add AG-UI streams to existing threads

Connect your app to CopilotKit Intelligence to add AG-UI streams while keeping your existing thread provider. Start with [Add AG-UI Streams to Existing Threads](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/ms-agent-python/threads-import). To also include earlier conversations in your app, follow the optional history import steps for [Google ADK](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/google-adk/threads-import) or [LangGraph](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/langgraph-python/threads-import).

### Configure your Runtime with CopilotKit Intelligence#

Your `CopilotRuntime` must be connected to CopilotKit Intelligence before the thread UI can list and resume conversations. That connection is the `intelligence` option below — a `CopilotKitIntelligence` instance. If your app came from a CLI starter, this Runtime configuration is generated for you. Otherwise, follow [Connect your runtime to Intelligence](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/ms-agent-python/intelligence/quickstart) for the full constructor, then return here to add the headless UI. Thread names are automatically generated by the LLM after the first message — you can disable this with `generateThreadNames: false`.

server.ts
    
    
    import {
      CopilotKitIntelligence,
      CopilotRuntime,
    } from "@copilotkit/runtime/v2";
    
    const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
      agents: {
        default: agent,
      },
      // Without `intelligence` the runtime runs in SSE mode and the thread
      // UI has nothing to list — chat still works, so this fails quietly.
      intelligence: new CopilotKitIntelligence({
        apiKey: process.env.CPK_INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY!,
      }),
      // Required alongside `intelligence`: threads are scoped per user, so
      // without this every visitor shares one history. Resolve the real
      // signed-in user — see Thread & History Lifecycle.
      identifyUser: async (request) => {
        const session = await verifyAppSession(request);
        if (!session?.user) throw new Error("Unauthorized");
        return { id: session.user.id, name: session.user.name };
      },
      // Thread names are auto-generated by default.
      // Set to false to disable:
      // generateThreadNames: false,
    
      // Optional: tune thread lock behavior
      // lockTtlSeconds: 20,              // Lock TTL (default 20s, max 3600s)
      // lockHeartbeatIntervalSeconds: 15, // Heartbeat interval (default 15s, max 3000s)
      // lockKeyPrefix: "my-app",          // Custom Redis key prefix for the lock
    });

CLI `init` and its `create` alias write the cloud-hosted platform URLs, `SL_ENABLED`, project-scoped `CPK_INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY`, and optional `CPK_TELEMETRY_ID` to `.env`.

Keep `CPK_INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY` on the server. The project key connects the Runtime to Intelligence; the telemetry ID is a non-secret analytics identity.

Cloud-hosted setup does not issue `COPILOTKIT_LICENSE_TOKEN`. That token is only for offline or self-hosted licensing and does not replace the cloud-hosted project API key.

Existing Intelligence-enabled apps should keep their current server-side Runtime configuration.

Production self-hosting uses the same React APIs and is deployed with CopilotKit Engineering through [Self-host CopilotKit Intelligence](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/ms-agent-python/intelligence/self-hosting).

**Thread lock options:** When an agent run starts, the runtime acquires a lock on the thread to prevent concurrent runs. You can tune this behavior:

Option| Default| Max| Description  
---|---|---|---  
`lockTtlSeconds`| `20`| `3600` (1 hour)| How long the lock is held before it expires automatically.  
`lockHeartbeatIntervalSeconds`| `15`| `3000` (50 min)| How often the runtime renews the lock during a run.  
`lockKeyPrefix`| —| —| Custom Redis key prefix for the thread lock. Useful when multiple apps share a Redis instance.  
  
### List and manage threads with useThreads#

Use the `useThreads` hook to fetch and manage threads for a specific agent. The hook returns the thread list, loading state, and mutation methods.

ThreadSidebar.tsx
    
    
    import { useThreads } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2"; 
    
    function ThreadSidebar() {
      const { 
        threads,
        isLoading,
        renameThread,
        archiveThread,
        deleteThread,
      } = useThreads({ agentId: "my-agent" });
    
      if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
    
      return (
        <div>
          {threads.map((thread) => (
            <div key={thread.id}>
              <span>{thread.name ?? "New conversation"}</span>
              <button onClick={() => renameThread(thread.id, "Renamed")}>
                Rename
              </button>
              <button onClick={() => archiveThread(thread.id)}>
                Archive
              </button>
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>
      );
    }

The `threads` array is sorted by most recently updated first and stays synchronized in realtime — new threads from other tabs or devices appear automatically.

**Archive vs. delete:** `archiveThread` is a soft delete — the thread stays in the database but is hidden from the list by default. Pass `includeArchived: true` to show archived threads. `deleteThread` is permanent and irreversible. Neither has a built-in confirmation dialog — add your own if needed.

### Switch between threads#

When a user selects a thread, pass its `threadId` to your chat component. The chat clears the current messages, fetches the selected thread's history, and replays it. If the agent is still running on that thread, the chat picks up the live stream.

App.tsx
    
    
    import { CopilotChat } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2"; 
    import { useState } from "react";
    
    function App() {
    const [activeThreadId, setActiveThreadId] = useState<string | undefined>();
    
      return (
        <div className="flex">
          <ThreadSidebar onSelectThread={setActiveThreadId} />
          <CopilotChat threadId={activeThreadId} /> {}
        </div>
      );
    }

When `threadId` changes, the chat component automatically loads the selected thread's history and reconnects to the agent's stream. If the agent is still running on that thread, the chat picks up the live stream.

### Add pagination for large thread lists#

For users with many conversations, use the `limit` parameter to enable cursor-based pagination.

ThreadSidebar.tsx
    
    
    const {
      threads,
      hasMoreThreads,
      isFetchingMoreThreads,
      fetchMoreThreads,
    } = useThreads({
      agentId: "my-agent",
      limit: 20, 
    });
    
    // In your JSX:
    {hasMoreThreads && (
      <button
        onClick={fetchMoreThreads}
        disabled={isFetchingMoreThreads}
      >
        {isFetchingMoreThreads ? "Loading..." : "Load more"}
      </button>
    )}

## Driving one agent per thread#

`useThreads` lists and switches threads. To read or run an agent **scoped to a specific thread** — one open tab per thread, for instance — pass all three of `agentId`, `runtimeAgentId` and `threadId` to `useAgent`:
    
    
    const { agent } = useAgent({
      agentId: `chat-${threadId}`, // local id, unique per mounted thread
      runtimeAgentId: "default",   // the one runtime agent they all route to
      threadId,                    // the thread this instance is pinned to
    });

This registers a private proxied agent per hook, so several threads can be mounted at once against a single runtime agent. `agent.runAgent()` then addresses that thread.

The three properties are a matched set and partial combinations do not compile. In particular `useAgent({ agentId, threadId })` is a type error: a runtime agent is a singleton, so pinning a thread directly onto it would let two hooks sharing an `agentId` overwrite each other's thread. See the [`useAgent` reference](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/reference/hooks/useAgent) for the full rules.
